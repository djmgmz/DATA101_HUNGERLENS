## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up HungerLens locally for development and testing.

---

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/) ‚Äì Version 18 or later is recommended
- [**npm**](https://www.npmjs.com/) ‚Äì Comes with Node.js

---

## üì¶ Installation

Install all required dependencies:

```bash
npm install @chakra-ui/react@^2.10.4

## üì• Preparing the Data

Before running the app, you need to generate the required CSV file for food prices. This must be done through the companion **Google Colab notebook**, which scrapes and compiles the data from public sources.

‚û°Ô∏è [Open the Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/) *(insert your actual notebook URL here)*

This process will output a file named `combined_country_food_prices.csv`, which you'll need to download and place in your project directory.

> **Note:** If you're modifying the notebook, ensure that libraries such as `requests`, `pandas`, and `beautifulsoup4` are installed.
